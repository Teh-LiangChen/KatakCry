# 🐸KatakCry🐸 

**KatakCry** is a personal experimental project where I explore malware creation and behavior **for educational and research purposes only**. This repository is intended to document my learning in malware development, reverse engineering, and system internals.

**Disclaimer**
This project is created purely for **educational purposes**. The code and techniques shared here should only be used in **isolated, controlled environments** (e.g., virtual machines) and **never on unauthorized systems**.  
I do not condone any illegal or unethical use of this knowledge.
